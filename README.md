# PyRPG
My old text based rpg project

How to open

# open IDLE file  

# navigate to the Main(open this file)

Tips on how to play

# you can only run this on idle

# when it says press anywhere press enter

# the keys you need for battling is the numberpad/numbers, backspace and enter on your keyboard

# if you want to go back on a choice, press enter without typing anything

# for best presentation, go fullscreen

thanks for playing  :)
